	        	It could have been called boxball. In the winter of 1891, James Naismith, 
	        	an instructor at a YMCA training school in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
	        	asked the janitor to hang a couple of boxes from the gymnasium balcony for 
	        	an experimental indoor ball game. The game became known as basketball because 
	        	the janitor, unable to find boxes to make the elevated goals, nailed up two 
	        	half-bushel peach baskets. Naismith came up with the game in hopes of curing 
	        	the winter doldrums of his students who had grown bored with the routine of gymnastics 
	        	and calisthenics. Naismith first experimented with indoor versions of rugby, lacrosse, 
	        	and other sports, but they proved too violent. The former divinity student eventually 
	        	struck upon the idea of upright goals that would minimize the force on the ball 
	        	and keep some distance between the players and the actual scoring. Thus the 
	        	internationally popular game of basketball was born.

				The inventor’s “fundamental principles” of basketball, and most of the 13 original 
				rules he posted a century ago, have endured. By penalizing offensive or defensive 
				fouls, court officials preserve the sport’s old-fashioned ideals. But style and 
				performance give modern basketball a wholly different look. The new era’s superstars 
				perfected moves that earlier players could never have imagined—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 
				skyhook, Wilt Chamberlain’s finger roll, Julius Erving’s slam dunk, Magic Johnson’s 
				no-look pass, Michael Jordan’s hang time.
				<br />
				<br />
				Basketball has always enjoyed great popularity. Within a decade of its invention 
				there were women’s teams, professional circuits, and an intercollegiate conference. 
				The game quickly spread to Canada, Europe, and Australia. Today young people play 
				basketball in grade school, high school, college, and at athletic clubs. 
				In addition to amateur teams, there are professional leagues and independent 
				professional clubs throughout the world.
				<br />
				<br />
				Broadcasts of the games played in international leagues, the National 
				Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Basketball Association 
				(NBA) make basketball one of the most-watched sports on television. Lucrative 
				contracts for the network and cable television rights to broadcast NBA games 
				pushed the average NBA player’s guaranteed salary to more than 4 million dollars 
				per year in 2004.
