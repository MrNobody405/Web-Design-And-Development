			<div id = "blog"> 
	        	Basketball requires concentration. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 
	        	“Concentration is the secret of strength.” Before
				we can get it, do you really know what concentration is?	        
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>What is concentration?</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Concentration means to condense the intensity of action 
				and to have mental focus. In sports psychology, it is
				your ability to focus on specific information while ignoring others.
				<br />
				<br />
				For example, a young athlete learning to dribble most devote total concentration toward that one task whereas a
				pro player devotes no concentration toward dribbling the ball. A sports psychologist can help athletes hone their
				concentration through mental imagery, elimination of distraction, and discipline.
				<br />
				<br />
				Experts on concentration say concentration focuses your thoughts and feelings toward the success of the goal

	        	his playing career this coming season.

				<br />
				“I don’t know,” Haslem said after completing a presentation on 
				behalf of his foundation. “We’re thinking about it. But either 
				way, I’m always going to be a part of the Heat family. I ain’t 
				going nowhere, whether I play or not. I’m always going to impact

				The Heat have kept a roster spot open for Haslem should he want it.

				<br />
				Last year, Haslem announced his return for a 19th season on Aug. 15.
				<br />

				Haslem is expected to become only the third player to spend an

				has accumulated over the years, most notably having worked in the San Antonio 
				front office, makes this one of the most significant hires we’ve made in a long

				Hunter, an Olympic Gold Medalist, two-time WNBA Champion, WNBA

				"I think anybody you ask that question that plays basketball, if he said no,
