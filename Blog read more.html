	        	IMPROVE YOUR CONCENTRATION ON AND OFF THE BASKETBALL COURT</div>
	        <div id = "blogs">
	        	Basketball requires concentration. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, 
	        	“Concentration is the secret of strength.” Before
				we can get it, do you really know what concentration is?	        
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>What is concentration?</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Concentration means to condense the intensity of action 
				and to have mental focus. In sports psychology, it is
				your ability to focus on specific information while ignoring others.
				<br />
				<br />
				For example, a young athlete learning to dribble most devote total concentration toward that one task whereas a
				pro player devotes no concentration toward dribbling the ball. A sports psychologist can help athletes hone their
				concentration through mental imagery, elimination of distraction, and discipline.
				<br />
				<br />
				Experts on concentration say concentration focuses your thoughts and feelings toward the success of the goal
				or task at hand.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Basketball Concentration</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				This could be called fundamentals. It is the concentrated effort and focus to build skills which gain strength,
				accuracy, and execution. It is a highly neglected aspect for youth sport right now. The brain learning a skill needs
				devoted, accurate repetition to codify the skill into an intuitive response. This takes time--significantly more time
				than we are giving as a basketball culture. From this bedrock of fundamental skills emerges basketball pattern
				recognition, higher levels of basketball IQ, play-making, and elite talent.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Individual Skill Set is Crucial</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Basketball in many ways has become an individual game where five people on the court work to provide an
				offensive overload for a player to beat their man. Many college offenses have a strategy of using up the clock,
				then attack the basket in a clear-out, one on one scenario. Serious players must have the ability to defensively
				stop any matched opponent and score quickly in a one-on-one. This demands the defense double team a strong
				offensive player, leaving wide open possibilities.
				<br />
				<br />
				<strong>Why are you there? And what do you want to accomplish?</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				These crucial questions establish your level of interest and helps your brain concentrate on what is important.
				<br />
				<br />
				Understand why you are losing concentration. Do you know why your mind wanders when your coach is
				talking causing you to miss key messages?
				<br />
				<br />
				Your mind wandered from your coach because you were either apathic, or anxious. Apathy is boredom, and
				boredom seeks escape. Anxiety is painful, and the mind in pain seeks to escape
				<br />
				<br />
				Do you know why you lost track of your position and didn’t block out?
				Your mind wandered from its task because you were distracted by something else. Perhaps, you were distracted
				by something external—a shove, a push, focus on the ref or the coach. Perhaps, you were distracted by
				something internal--- thinking ahead to the outcome of the game, or how you want to get open on offense before
				you finished your job on defense.
